Welcome to my website! I'm a PhD student studying at the [Jodrell Bank Center for Astrophysics](https://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/). My research focuses on the high-redshift universe, primarily using the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/). My supervisors are Professor Christopher Conselice and Dr. Nathan Adams. 

Prior to my PhD I I spent the final year of my Master's degree working at the [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](https://cfa.harvard.edu) working with Dr. Peter Maksym on AGN feedback. 

You can learn more about my research [here](http://www.thomas-harvey.com/research/) or see a list of my publications [here](http://www.thomas-harvey.com/research/). I'm also interested in outreach and science communication, and reguarly provide public lectures on astronomy for local groups and schools, as well as writing articles and newsletters for a local astronomy group.

Please get in touch using the information in the sidebar if you have any questions!

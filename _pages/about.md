Welcome to my website! I'm a PhD student studying at the [Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics](https://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/). My research focuses on galaxy evolution in the early Universe. My supervisors are Professor Christopher Conselice and Dr. Nathan Adams.

In brief, my PhD project is to study the formation and evolution of galaxies within the first billion years of the Universe, using data from the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://hubblesite.org) and the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://webb.nasa.gov). My work focuses on the stellar properties of galaxies, such as their stellar masses and star formation histories, often using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting techniques. I also work on the development of new methods to study the stellar populations of galaxies, such as the use of machine learning techniques to accelerate robust inference of galaxy properties. As a member of the EPOCHS team and the [PEARLS collaboration](https://sites.google.com/view/jwstpearls), I am also involved in a number of other projects, including helping to develop and run a new pipeline for automated galaxy cataloguing and SED fitting.

You can learn more about my research [here](http://www.thomas-harvey.com/research/) or see a list of my publications [here](http://www.thomas-harvey.com/research/). I'm also interested in outreach and science communication, and regularly provide public lectures on astronomy for local groups and schools, as well as writing articles and newsletters for a local astronomy group.

Prior to my PhD I spent the final year of my Master's degree working at the [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](https://cfa.harvard.edu) working with Dr. Peter Maksym on AGN feedback.

I will be submitting my thesis in early 2026, and I am currently looking for postdoctoral positions in astrophysics. If you are interested in my work, please feel free to get in touch!
